# Join Us

== Prospective Members
I enjoy working with talented students. I will design individual projects for every student and work closely with them, providing hands-on supervision to help them build skill trees in scientific research. I respect and protect students' innovative ideas, and support students' personal development plans.
If you are interested in joining my lab, please read the instructions below before sending me an email with a *one-page cover letter and your full CV*.

=== General Requirements
- Enjoy research
- Integrity
- Optimistic and positive life attitude
- Work smart and self-motivated

=== Graduate Students
- We admit Master student at the *College of Air Traffic Management, under subject code 082300*.
- Please read the Research and Publication pages on our website and see if you are really interested in our research areas.
- We hope you don't resist coding, because all research ideas are realized by writing scripts. 
- We try our best to provide full support in research activities, including research materials, CPUs and GPUs, journal publication, conference attendance, etc.

=== Undergraduate Students at CAUC 
- Undergraduate students majoring in transportation management or air traffic, computer science, applied mathematics and relevant subjects are welcome to join my research group.
- Before contacting me, please make clear your motivation and expectations. *SIX months is the minimum duration of a project, during which please make sure that you can guarantee the minimum time spent on research* (16 hours per week during the semester and 32 hours a week during summer or winter vacations).
- Undergraduate students are considered equally in our research group. We welcome you to work in the lab, join lab activities, and support your research needs.
- I can advise Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Programs. But I currently am *NOT* keen on advising non-research contests like China International College Students' Innovation Competition and the Challenge Cup.
